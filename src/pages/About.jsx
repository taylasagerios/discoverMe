        I was born in Lima, Peru and we moved to the States in 1998 where we lived in GA for most of my life.<br />
        I went to School at Mercer University in GA for Computer Engineering and Computer Science, but didn't quite finish.<br />
        After school, I worked a variety of food service jobs and eventually became a manager of a coffee shop in Macon, GA.<br />
        I then moved to Portland, OR for 4 years where I worked at a retail store as a clerk and then assistant manager.<br />
        Due to the deteriating health of my grandmother worsening I moved back to GA in May 2023.<br />
        This gave me a kick in the pants to revitilize my desire to work as a developer and join a coding bootcamp.
